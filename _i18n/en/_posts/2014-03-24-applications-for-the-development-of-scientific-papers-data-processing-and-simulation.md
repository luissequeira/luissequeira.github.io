## Results presentation

The way in which the research results are presented has a significant impact on readers. Also, a good way to represent the information gives a clear and easy ideas to understand. For this, **we need a selection of tools that allow the reproduction of documents, photographs, graphics, and other associated items**. On the other hand, there are various applications which facilitate the data processing when **we need to work with research result, whether mathematical or network**.

Below, a list of useful applications for **processing data from research, documents, images and other related management system** is described.

### For document and book editing in different formats:

- **LaTeX**: Language to automatically prepare a document with standard appearance and high quality. LaTeX is a high quality writing system that includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation.
- **Texmaker**: An easy-to-use LaTeX editor, configure, intuitive and with a lot of predefined functions, facilitating users to use LaTeX.
- **LibreOffice**: Set of office productivity applications. The office suite LibreOffice includes plugins for interaction with LaTeX.
- **kbibtex**: BibTex Editor for managing bibliography in LaTeX. Search built which include major databases for searching scientific and academic articles: Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, IEEEXplore, ACM and others.
- **Bibus**: Software for managing references databases. It is intuitive, easy to use, works with LibreOffice.org, OpenOffice.org (Linux, Windows, MacOS X) and MS Word (Windows).
- **Sigil**: Cross-platform and open source EPUB Editor to create e-books. Supports EPUB files, html, images and style sheets.
- **Calibre**: Library Manager for e-books and converter between different formats (EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF and many others).
- **Kate**: Advanced text editor with split windows and multidocument interface. Allows automatic scripts identification and other useful features for program editing.
- **PDFSam**: Tool to split and merge PDF documents.

### For image and graphic editing:

- **Inkscape**: Vector Graphics Editor that is fully compliant with XML, SVG, and CSS2 standards. It has capabilities similar to Illustrator, CorelDraw or Freehand.
- **Gimp**: Digital images editor that can be used for professional photo retouching, simple drawing creation or as format converter.
- **Dia**: Diagram editor for flowcharts, networks, etc.
- **Planner**: Project Manager which allows you to generate Gantt charts. Tool for project management, including planning, monitoring and export to different formats.

### For mathematical processing and simulation:

- **Scilab**: High-level Math tool for scientific computing.
- **Octave**: Mathematical analysis tool similar to Matlab commands.
- **NS-2**: Discrete event network simulator research-oriented. NS-2 provides substantial support for simulation of TCP, routing, and multicast protocols over wired and wireless networks, both local and satellite.

### For traffic analysis:

- **Wireshark**: Powerful traffic analyzer with GUI or through command line.
- **Tcpdump**: Tool for capturing network traffic in real time by command line.

### Other important applications:

- Eclipse: Eclipse Rich Client Platform, a suite of programming tools open source platform.
- **VirtualBox**: Management environment platform for virtual machines. Excellent for running multiple operating systems on one computer.
- **keepassx**: An application that secures the management of personal information such as passwords, names, comments and other information in an encrypted database using AES or Twofish 256-bit keys.
- **Backintime**: Simple backup tool in Linux.
