I am a versatile and forward-thinking Cloud Professional with a strong background in designing and optimizing scalable cloud solutions. Leading a great team to deliver cutting-edge infrastructure. Combining technical excellence with a passion for research and innovation. I have successfully spearheaded projects at the intersection of technology and creativity. Driving strategic initiatives, fostering collaboration, and ensuring the success of cloud-based projects within a dynamic and growth-focused organization. 

I enjoy design and evaluation of cloud infrastructure and software solutions, implementation of technical show-cases, demonstrations and proof-of-concepts. At work, the main challenge is to integrate different network and software technologies to provide solution in a wide range of areas, e.g., virtual network functions, autonomous driving / connected vehicles, robotics, augmented reality and more recently in the quantum computing industry.

I love looking for solutions to engineering challenges, share knowledge, and also to share time with my family and the cats.
