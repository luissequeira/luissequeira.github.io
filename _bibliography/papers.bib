	abstract={Cooperative driving using connectivity services has been a promising avenue for autonomous vehicles, with the low latency and further reliability support provided by 5th Generation Mobile Network 5G. In this paper, we present an application for lane merge coordination based on a centralised system, for connected cars. This application delivers trajectory recommendations to the connected vehicles on the road. The application comprises of a Traffic Orchestrator as the main component. We apply machine learning and data analysis to predict whether a connected vehicle can successfully complete the cooperative manoeuvre of a lane merge. Furthermore, the acceleration and heading parameters that are necessary for the completion of a safe merge are elaborated. The results demonstrate the performance of several existing algorithms and how their main parameters were selected to avoid over-fitting.},

	abstract={A Video Surveillance System VSS is of primary importance in public transport hubs such as airports, train or bus stations but also inside the vehicle itself. In this paper, we present a heuristic architecture model for on-board video surveillance system based on Internet of Video Things IoVT devices which addresses the need for delivering smart video surveillance in public transport vehicles e.g., buses minimizing the impact on network performance. A proof-of-concept was implemented using a public Cloud Service Provider CSP and two Raspberry Pi as edge computing nodes. On the edge nodes, a Machine LearningML application was deployed along with a network-efficient video streaming system. On the other hand, laboratory tests are included to understand the network traffic dynamic, furthermore results are enhanced with a set of simulations in order to analyze the performance of a video streaming application and6differentcongestion control algorithms in terms of packet loss and delay.},

@article{ieee9171338,
	abstract={This article presents a data-driven framework for trajectory recommendation in automated and cooperative driving. The considered cooperative driving maneuver is lane-merge coordination, and while the trajectory recommendation can only be communicated to the connected vehicles, in computation of those recommendations both connected and unconnected vehicles are taken into account. The data-driven framework is implemented centrally, comprising of two main components of a traffic orchestrator TO and data fusion DF. The TO predicts the safest trajectories for connected vehicles involved in the lane-merge maneuver. The DF incorporates camera detected vehicles in order to map all vehicles, including connected and unconnected. To this end, the recommendations are built using various state-of-the-art machine learning ML techniques, including deep reinforcement learning and dueling deep Q-network. Our evaluations are conducted using the real-system deployed in the test track, with a mix of connected and unconnected vehicles. The results demonstrate the precision of predicted trajectories, and the percentage of successful lane merge achieved deploying different ML techniques.},

In these scenarios, real-time services as online games can also be present. This paper presents a set of experiments developed in a test scenario where an end device moves between different APs while generating game traffic. A WLAN solution based on virtual APs is used, in order to make the handoffs transparent for Layer 3. The results show that it is possible to maintain an acceptable level of subjective quality during the handoff. At the same time, it is set clear that the fact of having a gamer in an AP could be taken into account by radio resource management algorithms, in order to provide a better quality.},

	abstract={This paper compares two policies which can be used for multiplexing the traffic of a number of players of a First Person Shooter game. A network scenario in which a number of players share an access network has been simulated, in order to compare the policies in terms of a subjective quality estimator. The first policy, namely timeout, achieves higher bandwidth savings, while the second one, period, introduces less delay and jitter. The results show that the difference in terms of QoE is only significant when the number of players is small. Thus, in order to make the correct decision, the concrete network scenario and the characteristics of the router would have to be considered in each case, taking into account the estimation of the subjective quality that can be expected.},

@inproceedings{ieee6267042,
	abstract={All the routers include a buffer in order to enqueue packets waiting to be transmitted. The behaviour of the routers' buffer is of primary importance when studying network traffic, since it may modify some characteristics, as delay or jitter, and may also drop packets. As a consequence, the characterization of this buffer is interesting, especially when real-time flows are being transmitted: if the buffer characteristics are known, then different techniques can be used so as to adapt the traffic: multiplexing a number of small packets into a big one, fragmentation, etc. This work presents a preliminary study of how to determine the technical and functional characteristics of the buffer of a certain device as e.g. behaviour, size, limits, input and output rate, or even in a remote Internet network node. Two different methodologies are considered, and tested on two real scenarios which have been implemented; real measurements permit the estimation of the buffer size, and the input and output rates, when there is physical or remote access to the ``System Under Test''. In case of having physical access, the maximum number of packets in the queue can be determined by counting. In contrast, if the node is remote, its buffer size has to be estimated. We have obtained accurate results in wired and wireless networks.},

Given the increasing rate of connectivity in modern vehicles, and road infrastructure, cooperative driving is a promising first step in automated driving. The example scenario we explored in this paper, is coordinated lane merge, with data collection, test and evaluation all conducted in an automotive test track. The assumption is that vehicles are a mix of those equipped with communication units on board, i.e. connected vehicles, and those that are not connected. However, roadside cameras are connected and can capture all vehicles including those without connectivity. We develop a Traffic Orchestrator that suggests trajectories based on these two sources of information, i.e. connected vehicles, and connected roadside cameras. Recommended trajectories are built, which are then communicated back to the connected vehicles. We explore the use of different machine learning techniques in accurately and timely prediction of trajectories.},

	abstract={This paper studies the use of a traffic optimization technique named TCM Tunneling, Compressing and Multiplexing to reduce the bandwidth of MMORPGs Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games, which employ TCP to provide a soft real-time service. In order to optimize the traffic and to improve bandwidth efficiency, TCM can be applied when the packets of a number of players share the same link, which occurs in some scenarios, as e.g. the traffic between proxies and servers of game-supporting infrastructures. First, TCP/IP headers are compressed using standard algorithms that avoid sending repeated fields; next, a number of packets are blended into a bigger one and finally, they are sent using a tunnel. The expected compressed header size has been obtained using traffic traces of a real game. Next, simulations using a traffic model of a popular MMORPG have been performed in order to estimate the expected bandwidth savings and the reduction in packets per second. The obtained bandwidth saving is about 60 percent. Packets per second are also significantly reduced. In addition, the added delays are shown to be small enough so as not to impair players' experienced quality.},

	abstract={Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games MMORPGs have been reported as real-time applications using TCP. This surprising fact makes it interesting to study their behavior when sharing a link with other TCP flows. In this paper the coexistence of an MMORPG flow and an FTP background application is studied. A network scenario which fits an access network is simulated with NS2, using synthetic traffic of a game, generated according to a statistical model. The FTP background application uses different TCP variants. The results show that TCP Vegas is able to maintain a constant rate while competing with the traffic of the game, since it prevents packet loss and high queuing delays by avoiding the increase of the sending window size. In contrast, TCP SACK and TCP New Reno tend to indefinitely increase their window size, thus causing packet loss and adding undesired delays to the game traffic. Finally, small buffers have been proved to be more convenient when dealing with real-time applications, since big ones add higher delays.},

	abstract={Due to the Increasing deployment of real-time multimedia services like IPTV and videoconferencing, the Internet has new Challenges. These new real-time Applications require a reliable performance of the network so as to provide a good Quality of Service (QoS) so it is important for the services providers to estimate the quality offered; and regardless of the transport network to know the quality perceived by the user. For this it is important to have tools to evaluate the quality of service provided. This paper presents a system for IPTV quality assessment. This will allow us to study the user's perceived quality for different codecs, bit rates, frame rates and video resolutions, and the impact of the network packet loss rate, in order to determine the objective and subjective quality. We propose an application simulating packet loss as a function of network parameters, which can be used to obtain the received video with different network impairments, without the need for transmitting it. It has two main advantages: first, it avoids the need of transmitting the video a number of times; second, it allows test repeatability.},

	abstract={This paper studies the optimization of the traffic of a P2P-TV application SOPCast. First, a traffic characterization is deployed, and it is observed that the service generates a high rate of small UDP packet bursts between peers. Then, an optimization method based on header compression and multiplexing is used for sending together the packets with the same destination. Two multiplexing policies are defined and tested. The first one is based on a fixed multiplexing period, and the other one defines an inter-packet time threshold, with the aim of multiplexing together a whole traffic burst. Simulations using real traffic traces of SOPCast are performed in order to estimate the expected savings for both policies. The results show that the efficiency is improved, achieving uplink bandwidth savings between 26\% and 33\% for the period-based policy, and roughly 35\% for the policy based on a threshold. The amount of packets per second is also reduced by a factor of 10 in both cases. As a counterpart, the addition of a small retention delay is necessary, but the tests show that it does not impair user's experience.},

En primer lugar se presenta una caracterización del tráfico, obserándose que genera altas tasas de paquetes UDP de pequeño tamaño entre diferentes peer, presentando por tanto una eficiencia baja. Posteriormente se propone el uso de un método de optimización de ancho de banda basado en la compresión de las cabeceras y en la multiplexión de los paquetes originales. Se emplean dos políticas de multiplexión, la primera se basa en un período fijo y en la segunda se define un umbral para el tiempo entre paquetes. En las simulaciones se emplea una traza real del tráfico SOPCast, mostrándose para ambas políticas, una mejora en la eficiencia y valores significativos de ahorro de ancho de banda para el enlace de subida de un usuario (aproximadamente entre un 26% y un 35%). La cantidad de paquetes por segundo se reduce en un factor de 10 en ambos casos. Como contrapartida, se añade un retardo a los paquetes nativos, pero las pruebas muestran que no empeora la experiencia del usuario ni la calidad del vídeo percibido.},

@article{sequeira2014effect,
	abstract={This work presents an analysis of the buffer features of an access router, especially the size, the impact on delay and the packet loss rate. In particular, we study how these features can affect the Quality of Service (QoS) of multimedia applications when generating traffic bursts in local networks. First, we show how in a typical SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) network in which several multimedia flows (VoIP, videoconferencing and video surveillance) share access, the upgrade of the bandwidth of the internal network may cause the appearance of a significant amount of packet loss caused by buffer overflow. Secondly, the study shows that the bursty nature of the traffic in some applications traffic (video surveillance) may impair their QoS and that of other services (VoIP and videoconferencing), especially when a certain number of bursts overlap. Various tests have been developed with the aim of characterizing the problems that may appear when network capacity is increased in these scenarios. In some cases, especially when applications generating bursty traffic are present, increasing the network speed may lead to a deterioration in the quality. It has been found that the cause of this quality degradation is buffer overflow, which depends on the bandwidth relationship between the access and the internal networks. Besides, it has been necessary to describe the packet loss distribution by means of a histogram since, although most of the communications present good QoS results, a few of them have worse outcomes. Finally, in order to complete the study we present the MOS results for VoIP calculated from the delay and packet loss rate.},

	abstract={En el presente trabajo se propone una arquitectura capaz de mejorar la calidad de las comunicaciones multimedia en redes WLAN coordinadas, mediante la utilización de SDN Software Defined Networks. Para esto se requiere que dichas soluciones SDN sean adaptadas para poder identificar los parámetros propios de las redes Wi-Fi, tales como interferencias, movilidad, selección de canales, etc. y sean capaces de abordar los problemas derivados de los requerimientos de calidad de las estaciones que comparten la misma red inalámbrica.},

@article{ieee8371599,
	abstract={This paper presents a novel software-defined wireless network architecture that integrates coordination mechanisms to enhance the capabilities of a set of central managed Wi-Fi access points APs. The global architecture is presented in detail, where the handoff mechanism is integrated with a set of active and passive monitoring tools and other functionalities, resulting in a solution that is able to provide smart functionalities using low-cost commercial APs. The framework includes a central controller that has all the information available, and is therefore able to make smart decisions about the assignment of clients to APs. This avoids the problem of the ``sticky client''that remains connected to the original AP it is associated with, rather than moving to a nearby AP, which would be a better choice. Two different test scenarios are used to compare a proactive and a reactive handoff mechanism in realistic conditions, with different walking speeds. The results illustrate the advantage of the proactive handoff, as it is more scalable and allows a better integration with other functionalities such as load balancing. The delay incurred by the handoff between APs in different channels is measured with three wireless devices, using five values for the inter-beacon time, proving that fast and seamless handoffs are possible in the scenario. The paper shows that these advanced functionalities, usually available in proprietary solutions, can also be achieved using off-the-shelf equipment.},

@article{8863163,
	abstract={Many studies are concentrated on provisioning certain levels of Quality of Service (QoS) employing different approaches related to different areas (control congestion algorithms, transport protocols, etc). This paper is focused on the improvement of the QoS of peer-to-peer TV (P2P-TV), and in particular, it proposes a methodology to minimise the impact of bursty traffic in the buffer of access devices using a traffic shaping technique. This paper shows how QoS can be improved by means of traffic shaping, specifically by using smoothing techniques. Some parameters such as packet loss, delay and throughput of a popular P2PTV application are analysed. The competition for the available bandwidth between the P2P-TV and some Transport Control Protocol (TCP) traffic flows is also studied. The results show a reduction in terms of loss percentage when the traffic of the P2P-TV application is smoothed, introducing small delays as a counterpart.},

	abstract={Touch is seen as the modality that will complement hearing and vision as a third media stream over the Internet in a variety of future haptic applications. This chapter introduces the basics for haptic communication and discusses its quality of service and quality of experience requirements as well as the main key performance indicators (KPIs) for the Tactile Internet. In addition, it reviews and evaluates notable methodologies and technologies of bilateral teleoperation stability control and haptic data reduction, necessary components of the haptic communication infrastructure. Furthermore, the chapter takes into account the 5th Generation architecture, KPIs and some 3rd Generation Partnership Project components as well as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute Network Function Virtualisation management and orchestration capabilities that will allow haptic applications to take life, in combination with the haptic data communication protocols, bilateral teleoperation control schemes and haptic data processing needed.},
